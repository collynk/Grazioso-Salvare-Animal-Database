Purpose of the CRUD Python Module:
This CRUD Python module is developed for Grazioso Salvare to manage and interact with their MongoDB database. It's the (CRUD) or Create, Read, Update, and Delete entries in the database, this gives efficient and easy data management.

USE:
Python Driver for MongoDBâ€¦
The Python driver used for MongoDB in this project is pymongo. This driver was the best because it's what I know and it's super easy to use.  It integrates Python applications with MongoDB, making it great for managing MongoDB collections and documents.

CRUD Operations:
The module provides functions for each of the CRUD operations:
Create: Adds a new document to the MongoDB collection.
Read: Retrieves documents from the MongoDB collection.
Update: Modifies existing documents in the collection.
Delete: Removes documents from the collection.
